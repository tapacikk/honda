Project for scraping the web to buy a car in Los Angeles city

My wife says that the quality of the car correlates with car's age and price (she is new to Los Angeles)

Here I will scrape some data to see if that is the case. For that I will use some python and BS (Beautiful Soup)

Target websites:
1. Edmunds.com
2. Cars.com
3. craigslist.com
